# Working with Numerical Lists in Python

# See pp. 57 - 59 in the Python Crash Course book first!

# Part 1
# Use a for loop and the range ( ) function to
# generate and display the numbers 0 to 10

# Hint: The output for the range ( ) function stops when it reaches the second value you provide, so in
# this case, the last number generated will be 9
# How do you change your range ( ) function code so it actually displays the number 10?





# Part 2
# Use a for loop and the range ( ) function to
# generate and display the numbers 1 to 50




# Part 3
# Use the list ( ) function and the range ( ) function together 
# to generate a list of numbers from 1 to 20




# Part 4
# Use the list ( ) function and the range ( ) function together 
# to generate a list of ODD numbers from 1 to 30
# Hint: You'll need to include a STEP VALUE in your range ( ) function




# Part 5
# Create an empty list named cubes
# Then use a for loop and the range ( ) function to generate
# and add to the list the cube of each number 
# Hint: You'll also use the append ( ) method for this script
# See page 58 in the Python Crash Course book
